# The TON Footsteps

The list of the TON Footsteps represented in the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues) section.

### How to propose something to the list?
**Ideation Stage**
1. Open an [Footstep issue](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/new?assignees=&labels=footstep&template=Footstep.yaml). Name it using the name of your proposal
2. Fill the issue form or use [ton-footstep-issue-template.md](ton-footstep-issue-template.md) as a reference to explain a goal of the proposal. Use the [#3](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/3) issue like an example.

**Review Stage**
1. The community can comment, discuss and suggest changes to the proposal
2. The TON Footsteps [committee](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#the-ton-footsteps-committee) reviews proposals once a week. The committee labels an issue `approved` if approved. Otherwise, they close it

### How to complete something from the list?

2. Propose your plan or just ask to assign issue to yourself
3. Finish the task and verify that all task deliverables are completed
4. Open a pull request. Name it using the name of the task and put your name in the [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#hall-of-fame)
5. Leave a comment to link the pull request to the issue. For example: `PR for #3`
