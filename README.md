# The TON Footsteps

### How to propose something to the list?
**Ideation Stage**
1. Open an [Footstep issue](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/new?assignees=&labels=footstep&template=Footstep.yaml). Name it using the name of your proposal
2. Fill the issue form or use [ton-footstep-issue-template.md](ton-footstep-issue-template.md) as a reference to explain a goal of the proposal. Use the [#3](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/3) issue like an example.
