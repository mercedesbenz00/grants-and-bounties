# The TON Footsteps

The list of the TON Footsteps represented in the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues) section.

### How to propose something to the list?
**Ideation Stage**
1. Open a [Footstep issue](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/new?assignees=&labels=footstep&template=Footstep.yaml). Name it using the name of your proposal
2. Fill the issue form or use [ton-footstep-issue-template.md](ton-footstep-issue-template.md) as a reference to explain the goal of the proposal. Use the [#3](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/3) issue as an example.

**Review Stage**
1. The community can comment, discuss and suggest changes to the proposal
2. The TON Footsteps [committee](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#the-ton-footsteps-committee) reviews proposals once a week. The committee labels an issue `approved` if approved. Otherwise, they close it

2. Propose your plan or just ask to assign issue to yourself
3. Finish the task and verify that all task deliverables are completed
4. Open a pull request. Name it using the name of the task and put your name in the [Hall of Fame](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps#hall-of-fame)
5. Leave a comment to link the pull request to the issue. For example: `PR for #3`
