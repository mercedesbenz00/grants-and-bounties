# TON Footstep NFT

TON Footstep NFT is a functional NFT, which is dropped when TON Footstep is made.

By making a Footstep we consider that the relevant issue in [TON Foosteps](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps) gets resolved and accepted as completed.

## Minting process

NFT should be minted to the TON address provided by the person who completed the Foostep. This address should be provided in the issue itself. Later the practice might be improved by agreeing on a certain standard for providing such an address â€” either by applying for closing such an issue by interacting with a specific contract in TON blockchain or by having a special repository/gist, containing address for delivering the reward.

## NFT

Until SBT standard is developed and accepted, TON Foostep is going to be a NFT.
