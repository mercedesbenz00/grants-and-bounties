# Grant program guidelines

TON Grants Program is aimed at providing initial support for ambitious teams to kick off product development or migrate a successful existing product to TON from another blockchain. 

According to our current strategy, we prioritise projects that have a potential to activate and onboard the mass audience of Telegram into TON and web3 rather than those targeting crypto-natives. It means such products need to have a strong social element, easy onboarding and good UX to effectively attract and retain the web2 user. 

Apart from that, we always welcome initiatives that help enhance the TON overall infrastructure, facilitate the deployment of and interaction across DApps and Telegram Mini Apps, bring a unique value to the ecosystem and attract users and financial value from outside of TON. 

It is important to note that we do not support products that are identical to the ones that already exist on TON, focusing on novel innovative business cases, even if within one product vertical.

Applicants are thus invited to carefully study the [TON Ecosystem map](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map) as the first obligatory step in the application process. 

# Grant Categories

Projects that align with the following priority categories have an increased likelihood of receiving grant support from the TON Foundation:

## 1️⃣ Telegram Mini Apps (TMA): Social Web3 Use Cases inside Telegram

This category is mostly about social B2C applications inside Telegram with a clear vision of how to achieve virality and retain the user. Please note that the use of TON in your DApp is a mandatory requirement and that your focus should be on activating web2 users and bringing them on-chain. 

This category includes but is not limited to: 

- **SocialFi**: TMA that help creators monetize their social media content (e.g., FriendTech-like cases or a tool that helps crypto channel owners earn on sharing successful trades/new token launches)
- **Utility**: daily use TMA that fulfill some functional needs and necessarily use web3 to improve the UX of daily use cases (e.g., Calendar, Task tracker)
- **Community & Brand management**: tools aimed at engaging communities inside Telegram (e.g., Loyalty programs, Ticketing)

### 1.1. Initial Deployment

Directed to developing and deploying the Proof of Concept with the integration of [@wallet](https://wallet.tg/), [TON Connect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview), and/or [Wallet Pay](https://pay.wallet.tg/). 

**Grant size: up to $10K in TON**

### 1.2. Live Non-TON-based Projects with Substantial Traction

Directed to moving a project that is live on another blockchain to TON in the form of a TMA and transferring the user base. The grant amount in this case will depend on DAU, MAU, TVL, transaction volume and other relevant metrics. For example, for GameFi & Social DApps, we would prioritise products with DAU>5K, MAU>20K, R1 > 25%, R7 > 10%, R14 > 5%.

**Grant size: up to $50K in TON**

## 2️⃣ **GameFi**

The main criterion for this category is the presence of social mechanics and thus the potential to attract and retain the mass audience of players. There are two subcategories of games we are ready to support: 

- **Social games in the form of a TMA** with viral mechanics and features like sharing with friends, leaderboards, group challenges, and notifications.
- **Standalone games** (PC / mobile), preferably with strong social mechanics too

**Grant size: up to $10K in TON for initial deployment and up to $50K in TON for an existing game with sustainable metrics.** 

## 3️⃣ **Other**

This broad category consists of open-source technical projects; commercial projects that improve the TON infrastructure, including the deployment and interaction across DApps and Telegram Mini Apps; DeFi projects that significantly improve the current landscape.

We kindly ask the teams applying for this grant category to do very thorough research on the current infrastructural & business landscape of TON before submitting an application. Make sure your solution is technically feasible and can greatly enhance the ecosystem. 

**Grant size: up to $50K in TON**

> 🚫 Please kindly note that we generally do not fund a mere integration of TON into existing solutions like wallets / portfolio trackers / DEXs / NFT marketplaces etc, focusing on proposals that showcase the unique value and clearly state their focus on the TON ecosystem.

# How to raise the chances of being accepted

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. To increase your chances of being approved, you should strictly follow these Guidelines. Always remember that your grant application is essentially your pitch. 

**What can the funds be spent for?** 

Teams that plan to launch a product on TON from scratch can expect grant support for initial product development. Please note that we do not fund marketing campaigns at this stage. 

Teams that have a live product with substantial traction on another chain and want to move to TON can get support for both product development and the migration of their user base to TON. 

**Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:**

- It presents a clear description of the problem and your solution to it, and the proposed concept is well-researched and tested by the team. Priority will be given to projects that are able to demonstrate some early user traction (commercial use cases) or at least some technical work conducted (infrastructural cases).
- Your team has proven business experience in the respective field as well as the technical knowledge of relevant languages and technologies. Please note that we prioritise backing established teams with a proven track record of working together, and not solo developers. When describing your team, focus on the relevant achievements and numbers, showcasing the commercial traction that your previous products have.
- You effectively explain your user acquisition plan. Applications without a clear go-to-market strategy will NOT be considered.
- The application includes enough details on the functionality of your DApp / tool.
- You break down your project into specific milestones with reasonable timelines and expected outcomes and deliverables for each phase. Note that we do NOT provide grants for research, so please make sure not to include research activities among your milestones.
- A detailed and reasonable budget breakdown is provided. Justify each expense and ensure it aligns with industry standards.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after the completion of the grant, be it through additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors and implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet. Thoroughly think about your unique value proposition for the users of TON and explain how your solution is better than any product that exists either on TON or on other chains (please feel free to mention specific projects). We highlight again that a necessary step before submitting your application is to explore the [TON Ecosystem Map.](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map) We are happy to support multiple solutions in the same product vertical, but your differentiation must be clear.

# Grant rules

General requirements include the following:

- In case of our interest, we may **contact the team on Telegram** to have a more in-depth dialogue about their product and potential support from our side. The main takeaways and agreements will be reflected in the comment section of the original proposal on Questbook.
- In case we ask an applicant to resubmit the proposal, enriching it with more details, we would expect our request to be completed **within one week** or reject the original proposal otherwise.
- Teams receive funds **upon the completion of each milestone**. No advanced payment is envisioned by this grant program.
- Teams are asked to **finish a grant before applying for a new one.**
- Apart from grant, we are happy to offer grantees our **technical support** and connect with the relevant players in the ecosystem.
- We do NOT award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful **token sale.**
- We do NOT support projects that fail to offer a **real utility** to the end user.
- We do NOT fund projects that actively encourage **gambling, illicit trade, money laundering,** or criminal activities in general.
- A grant **may be cancelled** if the team fails to meet the deadlines (if the deadline is protracted by more than 1 month), is not responsive and collaborative or if the delivered milestones do not correspond to what what originally agreed upon.

Requirements specific to open-source technical projects:

- All code produced as part of this category of grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
