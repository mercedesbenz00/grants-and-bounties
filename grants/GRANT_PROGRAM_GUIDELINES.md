# Grant program guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. Projects funded through our programs are broad in scope, but our focus lies on strong technical projects that add value to the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

- It presents a well-researched or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources or an existing business model.
- Your team has proven experience with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- You can clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

## Grant rules and project requirements

Open-source technical projects may replicate existing, non-open-sourced solutions, while commercial initiatives must be unique to the ecosystem, requiring strong evidence of the team's capability to deliver the agreed functionality and achieve market traction.
  
General requirements include the following:
- Teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- We do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.
- A grant may be canceled if the recipient team fails to be responsive and collaborative on agreed milestones within one month of an update request from our team.

Requirements specific to open-source technical projects category:
- All code produced as part of this category of grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.

## Areas of interests
An overview of existing TON projects can be found in [TON Ecosystem map](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map).
Projects that align with the following priority categories have an increased likelihood of receiving grant support from the ecosystem.

### Infrastructure
- Web IDE
- API Provider (for GraphQL & Event Streaming)
- Nodes Healthcheck & Monitoring
- Self-Deployed Node Images for Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, etc.)

### GameFi
- Games in Telegram (especially with new use cases for NFT, jettons and social mechanics)
- HTML5 Engines Support (similar to [Unity SDK](https://docs.tonplay.io/sdk/unity-sdk), but for Cocos2d or Phaser)
- Scolarships (e.g., YGG) and tools for them (e.g., GuildFi)
- Rarity tools (e.g., rarity.tools) 
- NFT Lending (e.g., nftfi.com)
- Meta transactions, gasless onboarding
  
## Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Grant Proposals

When submitting a grant proposal, it's essential to ensure that your submission is clear, concise, and aligns with the goals of TON Grants program. Based on common rejection reasons, here's a guide to help you understand what might lead to a proposal being declined and how to avoid these pitfalls:

1. **Unclear or Misleading Proposals**
   
**Issue:** Proposals that are vague, use misleading terminology, or lack a clear objective are often rejected.
**Solution:** Clearly define the problem you're addressing. Use straightforward language and avoid jargon. Clearly state the objectives and expected outcomes of your project.

3. **Lack of Detailed Milestones**
   
**Issue:** Proposals without a clear breakdown of milestones can be seen as lacking in planning or feasibility.
**Solution:** Break down your project into specific, achievable milestones. Provide timelines for each milestone. Detail the expected outcomes and deliverables for each phase.

5. **Overlap with Existing Initiatives**
**Issue:** In case TON Grants program already supports a similar project or initiative, your proposal might be seen as redundant. Same might apply if there is already a functioning project in TON Ecosystem with similar value proposition.
**Solution:** Research [TON Ecosystem Map](https://github.com/ton-society/ecosytem-map) to learn about existing projects and initiatives. Highlight what makes your proposal unique or how it complements existing efforts.

6. **Misalignment with Areas of Interests of TON Grants program**
**Issue:** Proposals that don't align with the specific areas of interest of TON Grants program are less likely to be approved.
**Solution:** Familiarize yourself with our [areas of interest](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/blob/main/grants/GRANT_PROGRAM_GUIDELINES.md#areas-of-interests). Tailor your proposal to align with these areas.

7. **Overpriced Budgets**
**Issue:** Proposals with budgets that seem inflated or don't provide a clear breakdown of costs can be rejected.
**Solution:** Provide a detailed budget breakdown. Justify each expense and ensure it aligns with industry standards. Be transparent about all costs involved.

8. **Lack of Expertise or Relevant Experience**
**Issue:** Proposals that don't demonstrate the necessary expertise or experience might be seen as high-risk.
**Solution:** Highlight your team's qualifications and past achievements. If possible, provide case studies or examples of past successful projects.

9. **Alternative Support Options**
**Issue:** Sometimes, the project submitting a proposal is a better fit for our other support programs.
**Solution:** Research all the programs and find the best fit for you.

10. **Independence and Self-Sustainability**
**Issue:** Proposals that seem overly reliant on grant funding without a clear path to self-sustainability can be less appealing.
**Solution:** Detail how the project will become self-sustaining after the grant period. Highlight any additional sources of funding or revenue streams.
